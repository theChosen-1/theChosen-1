# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Inshaal!

**`Software Developer`**

I'm a Sophomore at Drexel; Honors BSCS with minors in Data Science & Finance, concentrations in AI & Machine Learning and Computer Security & Privacy. Experienced in solving real-world problems using Neural Networks, with hands-on work in Deep CNNs and RNNs. Skilled in Python, JavaScript, and modern ML/DL libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. I thrive in collaborative teams, enjoy mentoring peers, and have a track record of turning ideas into working products; from interactive web applications to machine learning prototypes.
